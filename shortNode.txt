architecture -> attributes visible to the programmer.(instruction set, I/O mechanisms, addressing techniques)
Organization -> how features are implemented (control signals, interfaces, memory technology) 

3 main subsystems -> CPU, Memory, I/O devices

CPU -> execute the instructions in the main memory
memory -> stores intruction , data, provide them to the processor
I/O subsystem -> provides the means of communication between the computer system and the outside the world

Registers -> hold instructions, data, variables temporarity
            -> Genaral purpose registers -> hold data, variables, results
            -> Special purpose registers -> addresses, instructions

Control unit -> Genarate all the required control and timing signals

Program Counter -> always it holds address of a memory location where next instruction is stored

Instruction Register -> which holds the currrent instruction Exectuting

Memory Address Register -> It works as a buffer in between external and internal address bus

Memory Data Register -> It works as an intermediate unit in between external and internal data bus
